Castellanos Herrero @LiliaCH\r\n     - Esaú Balderas Zavala @EsauBz\r\n\r\nMain Purpose:\r\nYou will be able to direct a classical music ensemble. It may be a duet, a trio or a quartet. As the conductor, you will get the opportunity of choosing which ensemble you want to conduct;\r\n\r\n* Duet / Beethoven's Spring Sonata for piano and violin, 1st Movement excerpt.\r\n* Trio / Beethoven's Trio de l'Archiduc for piano, violin and cello, 2nd Movement excerpt.\r\n* Quartet / Mozart's Dissonance Quartet for violins, viola and cello, 2nd Movement excerpt.\r\n\r\nThe game is easy, you must place your hands in the designated space for each instrument depending on which ensemble you choose (you may find out more in the \"How To\" section in the game) upon the arrival of the instructions\r\n\r\n![Where to place your hands if you choose to conduct the Trio](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/objetos15162/Play-It-/master/Proyecto/images/ayuda_cartelestrio.png)\r\n\r\n![See the yellow squares? Those tell you when to tell the instruments to play. The G clefs on the right bottom corner tell you how many chances you have left for making a mistake.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/objetos15162/Play-It-/master/Proyecto/images/screenshot1.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you'd like to see how this game is organised click here:\r\n[Play It - Class Diagram](https://www.dropbox.com/s/cudzyaxyokx7ixc/diagramadeclases.png?dl=0)\r\n\r\nCheck out our video demonstrating how the game works!\r\n",
